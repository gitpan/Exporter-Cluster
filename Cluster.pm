=head1 NAME

Exporter::Cluster - Extension for easy multiple module imports.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In module ModuleName.pm:

 package ModuleName;
 require Exporter::Cluster;

 @ISA = qw( Exporter::Cluster );

 %EXPORT_CLUSTER = ( MODULE_1 => ARGS_1,
                     MODULE_2 => ARGS_2,
                     ...      => ...     );


In other files which to use ModuleName:

 use ModuleName;

All of the modules listed %EXPORT_CLUSTER will be available (after being
augmented by the import argument list if any) to the module that uses 
ModuleName.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Exporter::Cluster is designed to allow the user to develop a binding
package that allows multiple packages to be imported into the
symbol table with single 'use' command.  This module was created from 
the observation of the general trend of Perl packages growing in
complexity as new technology is developed and Perl interfaces
are designed to interact with this technology.  This is not a 
general use module!  It has been designed mainly for use by developers
who are trying to implement a sane interface to their work, but 
still attempt to use good coding practices such as code seperation
and modular design.

=head1 BUGS

No known bugs at this time.
