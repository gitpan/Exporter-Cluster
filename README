Exporter::Cluster version 0.2.5
===============================

I have noticed a general trend of Perl packages growing in complexity
as new technology is developed and Perl modules are made to interface
with these advances.  Designing and developing an interface to these
new interfaces can be (and most likely should be) a time consuming and
thought intensive task.  One of the hardest tasks is to use good coding
practices of code separation in the Perl modules.  If such practices
are followed to the extreme, the end user might have to have quite
large 'use' list at the top of each file.  The goal of Exporter::Cluster
is to implement a binding package that can reduce the list of closely
associated modules down to one 'use'.  This is not a general use module
as its abuse can be considered 'bad programming', but rather it is
intended for complex libraries or internal company use.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
